## Main Philosophy

Considering all the many different devices available, with different hardware and software resources, this plugin ALWAYS shows the notification, trying to use the maximum resources available. If the resource is not available, the notification ignores that specific resource, but shows the rest of notification anyway.

**Example**: If the device has LED colored lights, use it. Otherwise, ignore the lights, but shows the notification with all another resources available. In last case, shows at least the most basic notification.

Also, the Notification Channels follows the same rule. If there is no channel segregation of notifications, use the channel configuration as only defaults configuration. If the device has channels, use it as expected to be.

And all notifications sent while the app was killed are registered and delivered as soon as possible to the Application, after the plugin initialization, respecting the delivery order.

This way, your Application will receive **all notifications at Flutter level code**.

<br>

## How to show Local Notifications

<br>

1. Add *awesome_notifications* as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file.

```yaml
awesome_notifications: any # Any attribute updates automatically your source to the last version
```

2. import the plugin package to your dart code

```dart
import 'package:awesome_notifications/awesome_notifications.dart';
```

3. Initialize the plugin on main.dart, with at least one native icon and one channel

```dart
AwesomeNotifications().initialize(
    // set the icon to null if you want to use the default app icon
    'resource://drawable/res_app_icon',
    [
        NotificationChannel(
            channelKey: 'basic_channel',
            channelName: 'Basic notifications',
            channelDescription: 'Notification channel for basic tests',
            defaultColor: Color(0xFF9D50DD),
            ledColor: Colors.white
        )
    ]
);
```

4. Request the user authorization to send local and push notifications (Remember to show a dialog alert to the user before call this request)

```dart
AwesomeNotifications().isNotificationAllowed().then((isAllowed) {
  if (!isAllowed) {
    // Insert here your friendly dialog box before call the request method
    // This is very important to not harm the user experience
    AwesomeNotifications().requestPermissionToSendNotifications();
  }
});
```

5. On your main page, starts to listen the notification actions (to detect tap)

```dart
AwesomeNotifications().actionStream.listen(
    (receivedNotification){

        Navigator.of(context).pushName(context,
            '/NotificationPage',
            arguments: { id: receivedNotification.id } // your page params. I recommend to you to pass all *receivedNotification* object
        );

    }
);
```

6. In any place of your app, create a new notification

```dart
AwesomeNotifications().createNotification(
  content: NotificationContent(
      id: 10,
      channelKey: 'basic_channel',
      title: 'Simple Notification',
      body: 'Simple body'
  )
);
```

**THATS IT! CONGRATZ MY FRIEND!!!**

To run the examples, follow the steps bellow:

1. Install GitHub software in your local machine. I strongly recommend to use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
2. Go to one of the GitHub repositories
3. Clone the project to your local machine
4. Open the project with Android Studio or any other IDE
5. Sync the project dependencies running `flutter pub get`
6. On iOS, run `pod install` to sync the native dependencies
7. Debug the application with a real device or emulator

<br>
<br>

## Using Firebase Services (Optional)

The service used for this tutorial is Firebase Messaging, but you could use any other of your choice.

 1 - To activate the Firebase Cloud Messaging service, please follow the respective step for your desired platform:

### *Android*

First things first, to create your Firebase Cloud Message and send notifications even when your app is terminated (killed), go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.

After that, go to "Cloud Messaging" option and add an "Android app", put the packge name of your project (**certifies to put the correct one**) to generate the file ***google-services.json***.

Download the file and place it inside your [app]/android/app/ folder.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rafaelsetragni/awesome_notifications/master/example/assets/readme/google-json-path.jpg)

Add the classpath to the [project]/android/build.gradle file. (Firebase ones was already added by the plugin)

```editorconfig
dependencies {
    classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.5.0'
    // Add the google services classpath
    classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.3'
}
```

Add the apply plugin to the [project]/android/app/build.gradle file.

```editorconfig
// ADD THIS AT THE BOTTOM
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
```

<br>

### *iOS*

Based on [https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/messaging/apple-integration](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/messaging/apple-integration)

Go to "Cloud Messaging" option and add an "iOS app", put the package name of your project (**certifies to put the correct one**) to generate the file ***GoogleService-info.plist***.

Download the file and place it inside your [app]/ios/Runner/ folder using XCode. (Do not use Finder to copy and paste the file, use the XCode)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rafaelsetragni/awesome_notifications/master/example/assets/readme/google-plist-path.jpg)

After that, in your Google Console, go to **General (Gear icon) -> Cloud Messaging -> iOS configuration** and send your **APNs key** and include your **iOS Team ID**. To generate your APNs keys, follow the tutorial bellow:

https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/marketing/responsys-develop-mobile/ios/auth-key/


<br>

### Enabling Push Notifications in your Dart/Flutter code

(those steps are based on [https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/messaging/overview/](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/messaging/overview/) instructions)

2 - Add the `firebase_core` and `firebase_messaging` dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file.

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  firebase_core: "^1.0.4"
  firebase_messaging: "^9.1.2"
```

3 - Download the dependencies with `$ flutter pub get`.

4 - Inside your `main.dart` file, add the follow lines:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  AwesomeNotifications().initialize(
    'resource://drawable/res_app_icon',
    [
        // Your notification channels go here
    ]
  );

  // Create the initialization for your desired push service here
  FirebaseApp firebaseApp = await Firebase.initializeApp();
  FirebaseMessaging.onBackgroundMessage(_firebaseMessagingBackgroundHandler);

  runApp(App());
}

// Declared as global, outside of any class
Future<void> _firebaseMessagingBackgroundHandler(RemoteMessage message) async {

  // If you're going to use other Firebase services in the background, such as Firestore,
  // make sure you call `initializeApp` before using other Firebase services.
  await Firebase.initializeApp();

  print("Handling a background message: ${message.messageId}");

  // Use this method to automatically convert the push data, in case you gonna use our data standard
  AwesomeNotifications().createNotificationFromJsonData(message.data);
}
```

Now, firebase messaging should work at any application lifecycle, for any supported platform.

<br>

## Notification Life Cycle

Notifications are received by local code or Push service using native code, so the messages will appears immediately or at schedule time, independent of your application state.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rafaelsetragni/awesome_notifications/master/example/assets/readme/notification-life-cycle.png)

<br>

## Flutter Streams

The Flutter code will be called as soon as possible using [Dart Streams](https://dart.dev/tutorials/language/streams).

**createdStream**: Fires when a notification is created
**displayedStream**: Fires when a notification is displayed on system status bar
**actionStream**: Fires when a notification is tapped by the user
**dismissedStream**: Fires when a notification is dismissed by the user

<br>

| Platform    | App in Foreground | App in Background | App Terminated (Killed) |
| ----------: | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Android** | Fires all streams immediately after occurs | Fires all streams immediately after occurs | Fires `createdStream`, `displayedStream` and `dismissedStream` after the plugin initializes on Foreground, but fires `actionStream` immediately after occurs |
| **iOS**     | Fires all streams immediately after occurs | Fires `createdStream`, `displayedStream` and `dismissedStream` after the app returns to Foreground, but fires `actionStream` immediately after occurs | Fires `createdStream`, `displayedStream` and `dismissedStream` after the plugin initializes on Foreground, but fires `actionStream` immediately after occurs |

<br>

## Notification Structures

### Notification Layout Types

To show any images on notification, at any place, you need to include the respective source prefix before the path.

Layouts can be defined using 4 prefix types:

- Default: The default layout. Also is the layout used in case of any failure found on other ones
- BigPicture: Is the layout that shows a big picture and/or a small image.
- BigText: Is the layout that shows more than 2 lines of text.
- Inbox: Is the layout who lists messages or items separated by lines
- ProgressBar: Is the layout that shows a progress bar, such as download progress bar
- Messaging: (in construction)
- MediaPlayer: Is the layout that shows a media controller with action buttons, that allows the user to send commands without brings the application to foreground.

<br>

### Media Source Types

To show any images on notification, at any place, you need to include the respective source prefix before the path.

Images can be defined using 4 prefix types:

- Asset: images access through Flutter asset method. **Example**: asset://path/to/image-asset.png
- Network: images access through internet connection. **Example**: http(s)://url.com/to/image-asset.png
- File: images access through files stored on device. **Example**: file://path/to/image-asset.png
- Resource: images access through drawable native resources. On Android, those files are stored inside [project]/android/app/src/main/drawabe folder. **Example**: resource://drawable/res_image-asset.png

OBS: Unfortunately, icons and sounds can be only resource media types.
<br>
OBS 2: To protect your native resources on Android against minification, please include the prefix "res_" in your resource file names. The use of the tag `shrinkResources false` inside build.gradle or the command `flutter build apk --no-shrink` is not recommended.
To know more about it, please visit [Shrink, obfuscate, and optimize your app](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code)
<br>


### Notification Importance (Android's channel)

Defines the notification's importance level and how it should be displayed to the user.
The possible importance levels are the following:

- Max: Makes a sound and appears as a heads-up notification.
- Higher: shows everywhere, makes noise and peeks. May use full screen intents.
- Default: shows everywhere, makes noise, but does not visually intrude.
- Low: Shows in the shade, and potentially in the status bar (see shouldHideSilentStatusBarIcons()), but is not audibly intrusive.
- Min: only shows in the shade, below the fold.
- None: disable the respective channel.

OBS: Unfortunately, the channel's importance can only be defined on first time. After that, it cannot be changed.

<br>


### Notification Action Button Types


Notifications action buttons could be classified in 4 types:

- Default: after user taps, the notification bar is closed and an action event is fired.
- InputField: after user taps, a input text field is displayed to capture input by the user.
- DisabledAction: after user taps, the notification bar is closed, but the respective action event is not fired.
- KeepOnTop: after user taps, the notification bar is not closed, but an action event is fired.

<br>


|  Android           | App in Foreground | App in Background | App Terminated (Killed) |
| -----------------: | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Default**        | keeps the app in foreground | brings the app to foreground | brings the app to foreground |
| **InputField**     | keeps the app in foreground | brings the app to foreground | brings the app to foreground |
| **DisabledAction** | keeps the app in foreground | keeps the app in background  | keeps the app terminated |
| **KeepOnTop**      | keeps the app in foreground | keeps the app in background  | keeps the app terminated |

<br>

If the app is terminated (killed):
- Default: Wake up the app.
- InputField: Wake up the app.
- DisabledAction: Does not Wake up the app.
- KeepOnTop: Does not Wake up the app.

<br>


## Scheduling a notification

Schedules could be created from a UTC or local time zone, and specifying a time interval or setting a calendar filter. Notifications could be scheduled even remotely.
Atention: for iOS, is not possible to define the correct `displayedDate`, because is not possible to run exactely at same time with the notification schedules when it arives in the user status bar.

Notifications could be scheduled into two exclusive types:

- Interval: represents a interval of seconds that the notification should wait to be displayed
- Calendar: represents a simple set of date rules that the notification should obey to be displayed

Also, both of then could be configured using:

- timeZone: describe wich time zone that schedule is based (valid examples: America/Sao_Paulo, America/Los_Angeles, GMT+01:00, Europe/London, UTC)
- allowWhileIdle: Determines if notification will send, even when the device is in critical situation, such as low battery.
- repeats: Determines if the schedule should be repeat after be displayed. If there is no more valid date compatible with the schedule rules, the notification is automatically canceled.

For time zones, please note that:

- Dates with UTC time zones are triggered at the same time in all parts of the planet and are not affected by daylight rules.
- Dates with local time zones, defined such "GMT-07: 00", are not affected by daylight rules.
- Dates with local time zones, defined such "Europe / Lisbon", are affected by daylight rules, especially when scheduled based on a calendar filter.

Here are some practical examples of how to create a notification scheduled:

```Dart
  String localTimeZone = await AwesomeNotifications().getLocalTimeZoneIdentifier();
  String utcTimeZone = await AwesomeNotifications().getLocalTimeZoneIdentifier();
  
  await AwesomeNotifications().createNotification(
      content: NotificationContent(
          id: id,
          channelKey: 'scheduled',
          title: 'Notification at every single minute',
          body:
              'This notification was schedule to repeat at every single minute.',
          notificationLayout: NotificationLayout.BigPicture,
          bigPicture: 'asset://assets/images/melted-clock.png'),
      schedule: NotificationInterval(interval: 60, timeZone: localTimeZone, repeats: true));
```

```Dart
await AwesomeNotifications().createNotification(
  content: NotificationContent(
      id: id,
      channelKey: 'scheduled',
      title: 'wait 5 seconds to show',
      body: 'now is 5 seconds later'
  ),
  schedule: NotificationInterval(
      interval: 5,
      timeZone: localTimeZone
  );  
```

```Dart
  await AwesomeNotifications().createNotification(
      content: NotificationContent(
          id: id,
          channelKey: 'scheduled',
          title: 'Notification at exactly every single minute',
          body: 'This notification was schedule to repeat at every single minute at clock.',
          notificationLayout: NotificationLayout.BigPicture,
          bigPicture: 'asset://assets/images/melted-clock.png'),
      schedule: NotificationCalendar(second: 0, millisecond: 0, timeZone: localTimeZone, repeats: true));
```

```Dart
 await AwesomeNotifications().createNotification(
  content: NotificationContent(
    id: id,
    channelKey: 'scheduled',
    title: 'Just in time!',
    body: 'This notification was schedule to shows at ' +
        (Utils.DateUtils.parseDateToString(scheduleTime.toLocal()) ?? '?') +
        ' $timeZoneIdentifier (' +
        (Utils.DateUtils.parseDateToString(scheduleTime.toUtc()) ?? '?') +
        ' utc)',
    notificationLayout: NotificationLayout.BigPicture,
    bigPicture: 'asset://assets/images/delivery.jpeg',
    payload: {'uuid': 'uuid-test'},
    autoCancel: false,
  ),
  schedule: NotificationCalendar.fromDate(date: scheduleTime));
```

<br>

## Old schedule Cron rules (For versions older than 0.0.6)

Due to the way that background task and notification schedules works on iOS, wasn't possible yet to enable officialy all the old Cron features on iOS while the app is in Background and even when the app is terminated (Killed).
Thanks to this, the scheduling for android has also regressed to the iOS limitations level, to ensure for the developer the same behavior in any platform. But it could be manually reactivated in java native code.

A support ticket was opened for Apple in order to resolve this issue, but they dont even care about. You can follow the progress of the process [here](https://github.com/rafaelsetragni/awesome_notifications/issues/16).

<br>

## Emojis (Emoticons)

To send emojis in your local notifications, concatenate the class `Emoji` with your text.
For push notifications, copy the emoji (unicode text) from http://www.unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html and send it or use the format \u\{1f6f8}.

OBS: not all emojis work with all platforms. Please, test the specific emoji before using it in production.

```dart
  await AwesomeNotifications().createNotification(
      content: NotificationContent(
          id: id,
          channelKey: 'basic_channel',
          title: 'Emojis are awesome too! '+ Emojis.smille_face_with_tongue + Emojis.smille_rolling_on_the_floor_laughing + Emojis.emotion_red_heart,
          body: 'Simple body with a bunch of Emojis! ${Emojis.transport_police_car} ${Emojis.animals_dog} ${Emojis.flag_UnitedStates} ${Emojis.person_baby}',
          bigPicture: 'https://tecnoblog.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/emoji.jpg',
          notificationLayout: NotificationLayout.BigPicture,
  ));
```

<br>


## How to send Push Notifications using Firebase Cloud Messaging plugin (FCM)

To send a notification using Awesome Notifications and FCM Services, you need to send a POST request to the address https://fcm.googleapis.com/fcm/send.

Also, on our example app, you can find the class `FirebaseUtils` with all basic features you need to user `firebase_messaging` with `awesome_notifications`.

Due to limitations on Android and iOS, you should send a empty **notification** field and use only the **data** field to send your data, as bellow:

OBS: `actionButtons` and `schedule` are **optional**
<br>
OBS 2: ensure to read all the documentation inside [FlutterFire Overview Documentation](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/overview)
<br>
OBS 3: data only messages are classed as "low priority". Devices can throttle and ignore these messages if your application is in the background, terminated, or a variety of other conditions such as low battery or currently high CPU usage. To help improve delivery, you can bump the priority of messages. Note; this does still not guarantee delivery. More info [here](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/messaging/usage/#low-priority-messages)
<br>
OBS 4: Again, the background data only message method of the `firebase_messaging` plug-in runs in the background mode (which falls under iOS background execution rules) that can suspend all of your background executions for an indefinite period of time, for various reasons. Unfortunately, this is a known behavior of iOS and there is nothing to do about it. 15 minutes of delay is the smaller period of time possible between each execution. So, consider that the background method of `firebase_messaging` may not be executed at all or even run entirely out of the expected time.
<br>

            }
        },
        "actionButtons": [
            {
                "key": "REPLY",
                "label": "Reply",
                "autoCancel": true,
                "buttonType":  "InputField"
            },
            {
                "key": "ARCHIVE",
                "label": "Archive",
                "autoCancel": true
            }
        ],
        "schedule": {
            "timeZone": "America/New_York",
            "hour": "10",
            "minute": "0",
            "second": "0",
            "millisecond": "0",
            "allowWhileIdle": true,
            "repeat": true
        }
    }
}
```

Using this pattern, you can create a notification just by calling the method below:

```dart
AwesomeNotifications().createNotificationFromJsonData(yourReceivedMapData);
```

You can download a example of how to send Push Notifications through FCM using "Postman" [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rafaelsetragni/awesome_notifications/master/example/assets/readme/Firebase_FCM_Example.postman_collection.json)

## Notification channels
<br>

Notification channels are means by which notifications are send, defining the characteristics that will be common among all notifications on that same channel.
A notification can be created, deleted and updated at any time in the application, however it is required that at least one exists during the initialization of this plugin. If a notification is created using a invalid channel key, the notification is discarded.
After a notification being created, especially for Android Oreo devices and above, most of his definitions cannot be updated any more. To update all channel's definitions, it is necessary to use the ´forceUpdate´ option, which has the negative effect of automatically closing all active notifications on that channel.

Main methods to manipulate a notification channel:

* AwesomeNotifications().setChannel: Create or update a notification channel.
* AwesomeNotifications().removeChannel: Remove a notification channel, closing all current notifications on that same channel.

<br>

| Attribute          	| Required | Description                                                              | Type                   | Updatable without force mode | Value Limits             | Default value             |

## Common Known Issues

**Issue:** The name 'DateUtils' is defined in the libraries 'package:awesome_notifications/src/utils/date_utils.dart (via package:awesome_notifications/awesome_notifications.dart)' and 'package:flutter/src/material/date.dart (via package:flutter/material.dart)'.

**Fix:** Use a prefix while importing or hide one of the DateUtils declarations:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart' hide DateUtils;
import 'package:flutter/material.dart' as Material show DateUtils;

DateUtils.utcToLocal(DateTime.now());
Material.DateUtils.dateOnly(DateTime.now());
```

##

**Issue:** While my app is in background mode or terminated, my push notifications are successfully sent by `firebase_messaging`, but nothing happens in my background messaging handle

**Fix:** The background message method of the `firebase_messaging` plug-in runs in the background mode (which falls under iOS background execution rules) that can suspend all of your background executions for an indefinite period of time, for various reasons. Unfortunately, this is a known behavior of iOS and there is nothing to do about it. 15 minutes of delay is the smaller period of time possible between each execution. So, consider that the background method of `firebase_messaging` may not be executed at all or even run entirely out of the expected time.

**Issue:** So, because myApp depends on both awesome_notifications and "OtherPackageName" from sdk, version solving failed. pub get failed

**Fix:** The awesome_notifications plugin must be limited to all other last plugin versions in the stable bracket, to be the most compatible as possible to any flutter application in production stage.
Sometimes, one of our dependencies getting older and need to be updated.
Please, open a issue with this error on our GitHub community, and we gonna update it as fast as possible.
But, case necessary, you can manually upgrade those dependencies into your local files. Just change the pubspec.yaml inside your awesome_notifications local folder and you should be ready to go.

To see an example of how to solve it, please go to https://github.com/rafaelsetragni/awesome_notifications/issues/49

**Issue:** Invalid notification content

**Fix:** The notification sent via FCM services *MUST* respect the types of the respective Notification elements. Otherwise, your notification will be discarded as invalid one.
Also, all the payload elements *MUST* be a String, as the same way as you do in Local Notifications using dart code.
